# AI Career Assistant 🤖

AI Career Assistant is a Python-based chatbot designed to help students and freshers with
career guidance, resume support, and study/skill recommendations.

 **Note:** This project is a **rule-based chatbot with optional machine learning support**.  
It is **not a generative AI system** (like ChatGPT), but a structured chatbot built for learning and guidance purposes.

---

##  Features

- Career guidance based on user queries
- Resume-related assistance
- Study and skill roadmap suggestions
- Modular page-based application design
- Easy to extend with Machine Learning or NLP models

---

##  How It Works

1. The user enters a query through the application interface.
2. The chatbot matches the query with predefined intents.
3. Responses are generated using:
   - **Rule-based logic** defined in `intents.json`
   - **Optional ML-based classification** (if a trained model is available)
4. The appropriate response is displayed to the user.
